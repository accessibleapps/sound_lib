Introduction
=============

Sound_lib is a Python library that simplifies working with audio in Python applications.

It serves as a high-level wrapper around the powerful BASS audio library, incorporating most of BASS's add-ons to provide a comprehensive audio solution.

Why Sound_lib?
--------------

Sound_lib aims to make audio programming in Python more accessible and intuitive. It abstracts away many of the low-level details of the BASS library while still providing access to its powerful features.

* Cross-platform, tested on Microsoft Windows, MacOS, and Linux
* Support for playback of an incredible variety of audio formats
* Support for recording from a microphone or other input device
* Support for reencoding audio to a variety of formats
* Support for several audio effects
* Support for streaming files from disk, memory, or the internet
* Small yet efficient
* Well-documented

Getting Help
------------

If you're hung up on a certain function, class, or method it might be helpful to take a look at the comprehensive bass documentation directly (distributed with sound_lib but also obtainable online).

Bass also has a highly active `forum <http://www.un4seen.com/forum/>`_. When interacting there, it's important to remember that most of the good folks you'll encounter have never used and have no idea what sound_lib is or does. Thus, it's in your best interest to either describe the problem in layman's terms or point to actual bass functions.

If you're willing and able, do have a look at the portion of sound_lib that happens to be giving you trouble. It's quite possible that you might be facing a simple misunderstanding with the way things work. The force is with those who read the code after all.

If all else fails, you may have found a  bug in sound_lib. Please do let us know at our `github issue tracker <https://github.com/accessibleapps/sound_lib/issues/>`_. Thanks in advance for contributions!
